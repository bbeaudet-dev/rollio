# IDEAS

## Custom Dice Sets

### Inspirations 

Almost like a Faster Than Light loadout, but even more customization, almost more like the Gummi ships in Kingdom Hearts
- Just think about the EXCITEMENT you have about choosing your FTL loadout, and unlocking new ones. I want to emulate this same excitement

Or like Fallout, you have 8 qualities/characteristics/stats and a limited number of credits to put towards them; you can skew heavily towards 1 or 2, or have an even distribution

### Mechanics

Instead of static dice sets, players have a certain number of "credits" to put towards different things
You start with 6 standard plastic dice and 20 credits
Adding an extra die is 5 credits (and then maybe 10 for another one?)
Adding an essence is 3 credits (probably same cost for all essences?)
Buying charms range from 5-15 credits
Buying consumables, blessings
Pip effects 1 credit each

Different difficulties change starting credits / avialable upgrades
Any credits they don't spend lend to their starting money

Implications for the rest of the game: can players expect to be able to just "buy" materials/essences troughout the game, or is this a one-time loadout customization? The credits = money paradigm might be confusing then
